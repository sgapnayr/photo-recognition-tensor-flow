          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Introduction</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            The Body Part Recognition Application is a cutting-edge software solution that utilizes Tensorflow, React, and other advanced technologies to analyze and identify
            various body parts shown on a webcam. This application leverages machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to provide real-time feedback on the
            detected body parts, their confidence levels, and the ability to adjust the recognition threshold.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Components</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            The application consists of several key components that work together to deliver a seamless and interactive body part recognition experience:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 text-gray-500">
            <li>
              <strong>Webcam Integration:</strong> The application interfaces with the user's webcam, capturing live video feed for analysis and detection of body parts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Color Matching and Detection:</strong> By comparing the colors in the video feed with predefined color profiles of different body parts, the application
              identifies potential matches and determines the corresponding body parts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confidence Calculation:</strong> The application calculates the confidence level of the recognized body parts based on the matching scores and the
              user-defined threshold. This provides users with an estimation of the accuracy of the detected body parts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Threshold Adjustment:</strong> Users can customize the recognition threshold to control the sensitivity of the system. A higher threshold may result in higher
              confidence levels but could potentially miss some body part detections, while a lower threshold may lead to more detections but with potentially lower confidence.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Technologies Used</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            The Body Part Recognition Application employs a combination of state-of-the-art technologies to deliver its powerful functionality and user-friendly experience. The key
            technologies used include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 text-gray-500">
            <li>
              <strong>Tensorflow:</strong> Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework, forms the backbone of the application's body part recognition model. It enables
              efficient training and deployment of deep neural networks to perform accurate and real-time analysis of the webcam video feed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>React:</strong> React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, powers the frontend of the application. It provides a responsive and
              interactive interface, allowing users to view and interact with the detected body parts, adjust the threshold, and visualize the confidence levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Computer vision techniques, including color matching and detection algorithms, are employed to identify body parts from the video
              feed. These algorithms leverage image processing and pattern recognition to analyze the color composition and spatial relationships within the video frames.
